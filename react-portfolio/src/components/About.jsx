                Hi, Iâ€™m Mike, a junior developer dedicated to <br />
                continuous growth and learning in the world<br />
                of software development. Graduating with a <br />
                solid foundation in Computer Science, I am now <br />
                applying my skills to real-world applications. <br />
                In addition, I stay engaged by working on projects <br />
                and LeetCode to reinforce my knowledge. <br />
                Eager to accelerate my growth, I am always <br />
                seeking opportunities to enhance my skills.
